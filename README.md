Project 5

Describe your SQL queries and reports.
I used the SQL from the description.  I had trouble getting it to run in Power Query and Advanced Editor.  CHATGBT helped me find out that I needed to use the Advanced Options when connecting with ODBC.  

Here are the steps/

Open Power BI Desktop

Go to the Home tab at the top

Click Get Data ‚Üí Select ODBC

In the ODBC window, you‚Äôll see:

üîò Data source name (DSN) ‚Äî pick your DSN (e.g., SmartSalesDSN)

‚úÖ Below that, you‚Äôll see a small clickable ‚ÄúAdvanced options‚Äù link/dropdown.

üëâ Click on Advanced options and it will expand the panel.




Explain dashboard design choices.  
I designed my dashboard with the items called out in the instructions, but I did add all the items from seperated sections of the instructions.

Project 4

I had to change file paths to get the dw file in the correct location while still have the etl_to_dw.py in scripts folder.
I had to change the name of the columns.  I'm not sure if that is correct or not, but that worked for me.
I had to update the columns for the additional columns I had made.

```

Add a .gitignore file with:
# Python virtual environment
'.venv/'

# Visual Studio Code settings and workspace
'.vscode/'

added so .venv files will not be sent up to your repo.

Create a virtual environement by running this command
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment by running this command
```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
